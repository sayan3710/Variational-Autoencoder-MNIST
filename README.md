# Variational-Autoencoder-MNIST
### The reconstruction gets better as we increase the encoder hidden dimensionality to higher dimensions(>2). 
### Latent dimension of 2 was used for visualization puposes.
### Since we are using a combination of two loss functions it is important to keep a track of how much importance we are giving to each loss function. If one loss is prioritized over the other it is possible that either the reconstruction is poor or the encoding distribution is not contrained properly.
